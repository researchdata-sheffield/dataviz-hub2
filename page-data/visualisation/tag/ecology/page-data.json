These iconic and endangered shark-like rays were once found in warm, coastal waters of 90 nations and are now presumed extinct in more than half (n = 46). Researchers also predict that sawfishes are gone from at least nine additional nations.","tag":["Ecology"],"category":["School of Biosciences"],"featured":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#c8c8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/02c180650aa6fdff723520daef97c852/869a6/thumb.jpg","srcSet":"/static/02c180650aa6fdff723520daef97c852/0f5ce/thumb.jpg 750w,\n/static/02c180650aa6fdff723520daef97c852/b74b1/thumb.jpg 1080w,\n/static/02c180650aa6fdff723520daef97c852/6e2bb/thumb.jpg 1366w,\n/static/02c180650aa6fdff723520daef97c852/869a6/thumb.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/02c180650aa6fdff723520daef97c852/4f03f/thumb.webp 750w,\n/static/02c180650aa6fdff723520daef97c852/4f506/thumb.webp 1080w,\n/static/02c180650aa6fdff723520daef97c852/f0a0a/thumb.webp 1366w,\n/static/02c180650aa6fdff723520daef97c852/26222/thumb.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"author":[{"name":"Yu Liang Weng","avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0b4fd531c4d7e2b13cad834b37cad1fc/28b02/Y.L_Weng.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0b4fd531c4d7e2b13cad834b37cad1fc/28b02/Y.L_Weng.jpg 591w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0b4fd531c4d7e2b13cad834b37cad1fc/dacf8/Y.L_Weng.webp 591w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.9475465313028765}}}}],"rowSpan":1,"columnSpan":1},"fields":{"slug":"/visualisation/20/10/2021/Marine-Fishes-Near-Extinction","readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"pagePath":"/visualisation/tag/ecology","tag":"Ecology","allVisCatTag":[{"name":"Library","type":"category","count":1},{"name":"IT-Services","type":"category","count":1},{"name":"School of Biosciences","type":"category","count":1},{"name":"Department of Geography","type":"category","count":1},{"name":"School Of Health And Related Research","type":"category","count":6},{"name":"Research & Innovation IT","type":"category","count":1},{"name":"Institute for Sustainable Food","type":"category","count":1},{"name":"Department of Psychology","type":"category","count":1},{"name":"Dataviz Team","type":"category","count":1},{"name":"Management School","type":"category","count":1},{"name":"Energy Institute","type":"category","count":1},{"name":"FAIRness","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"F-UJI","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"shiny","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Ecology","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Inorganic arsenic","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Nutrients","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Alcohol Policy","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Gender","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Global Burden of Diseases","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Statistics","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Interative","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Food Insecurity","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"COVID-19","type":"tag","count":3},{"name":"COVID-19 lockdown","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Food intake","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Craving control","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Shiny","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Workplace conflict","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Wellbeing","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Business","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"Drax power station","type":"tag","count":1},{"name":"IDRIC","type":"tag","count":1}]}},
