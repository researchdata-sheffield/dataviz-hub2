It is also worth mentioning that these three modes are also frequently seen in other areas. Take statistical modeling as an example, if we were building a statistical model for a dataset we generally need to go through an exploration process to get a rough idea of the structure of the dataset at first. For example, we can plot a box plot to see the distribution of data points in quartiles or create a density plot to show the overall distribution. In the analysis stage one can use plots to assess the assumptions we have made on the dataset, and finally present the model in an interactive way or through some simple visualisations.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Some fascinating and informative examples [\", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://youtu.be/5g4kNMN4AsI?t=1968\"\n  }, \"start at 32:48\"), \"] for cultural data were presented during the workshop including those made by Olivia using \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://d3js.org/\"\n  }, \"D3.js\"), \" with \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://observablehq.com/\"\n  }, \"Observable notebooks\"), \".
