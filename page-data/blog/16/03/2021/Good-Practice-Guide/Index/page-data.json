This is because bar charts typically represent quantities or parts of a whole. There are very few exceptions to this. The same is not true for other charts, as Lea Gaslowitz shows, it is just as likely to be misled by a cut axis as an uncut one. So it's not a suitable answer to always start your charts at 0. You must take control of your y-axis scale. If it's necessary to fight with your software's default settings to achieve this, then do. If you do choose to cut, then make this abundantly clear to your readers. \"), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"step-11-add-a-detailed-figure-caption\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\"\n    }\n  }, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"h2\",\n    \"href\": \"#step-11-add-a-detailed-figure-caption\",\n    \"aria-label\": \"step 11 add a detailed figure caption permalink\",\n    \"className\": \"anchor before\"\n  }, mdx(\"undefined\", {\n    parentName: \"a\"\n  })), \"Step 11: Add a detailed figure caption\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"src\": \"/f0ecd3747643f048dae13e500c81330d/Step_11.png\",\n    \"alt\": \"Step 11\"\n  })), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Finally, all charts should have an informative title or a figure caption.
