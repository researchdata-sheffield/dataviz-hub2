Data is rarely \\u2018raw\\u2019, it is the consequence of\\nconscious decisions by those who collected the data and the social structure where it was collected. For example, D\\u2019Ignazio\\nand Klein highlight a case where historic data from a range of social services was used to train a model to predict child\\nabuse. As poorer families had previously had more interactions with public services there was more data about them in the\\ndatabases used, so the model over-estimated the levels of abuse in this community compared to wealthier communities (p. 39).\\nThis presents a challenge and places a responsibility on those visualising data to consider what is being communicated,\\nintentionally or not, through a visualisation. Traditionally the response to this has been to avoid evoking emotion and\\nattempt to be \\u2018neutral\\u2019, something D\\u2019Ignazio and Klein are critical of as likely to lead to representing the perspective\\nof the dominant groups in society (pp. 75-6). Instead they suggest, citing the works of Donna Haraway, Sandra Harding and\\nLinda Alcoff, that instead of aiming for a false neutrality researchers should situate their visualisations and the perspective\\nthe maker is coming from to help frame visualisations (p. 83). By doing so it is possible to help viewers understand the\\ncontext of a visualisation and better assess biases inherent in many datasets.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"None of this is to suggest that data visualisations are not important in communicating research but it is important to\\nrecognise that they are  \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u201Cabstractions and reductions of the world, the result of human choices, social conventions, and\\ntechnological processes and affordances, relating to generating, filtering, analysing, selecting, visualizing and\\npresenting data.\\u201D\"), \" (Kennedy & Engebretsen, p. 22).
