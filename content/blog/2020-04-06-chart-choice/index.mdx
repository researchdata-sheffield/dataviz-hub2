    When we visualise data, we present it in a form that is more engaging and
    easier to digest than plain numbers. Charts are the most common form of data
    visualisation and there are many different types to choose from. The charts
    that are most common are bar charts, scatterplots, horizontal bar charts,
    pie charts, histograms and line graphs.

    {" "}
    The most effective use of these charts are those that are <strong>
      clear, simple
    </strong> and <strong>intentional.</strong>{" "}
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Clear:</strong> Charts are used to inform. If the chart is overly
      complicated or unfamiliar to the target audience then it is not fit for
      purpose.{" "}
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Simple:</strong> Good chart design lets the data speak for itself.
      The inclusion of unnecessary flair like 3D columns, shaded or outlined
      bars can all detract from you are trying to convey with the chart.{" "}
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Intentional:</strong> You should know what story you are trying to
      tell with your data and what you want your reader to take from it before
      embarking on the visualisation.{" "}
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    {" "}
    Good chart design should accentuate the data itself and the story you are trying
    to tell, unnecessary clutter, or overly complicated charts can often detract
    from the intended message.{" "}

    {" "}
    Your choice of chart will be constrained the <strong>
      type of data
    </strong> you are working with,
    <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/"> this excellent decision tree</a>,
    created by 'from data to viz', lets you take a look at some of the most
    common data visualisations and their suitability for different data types.
  </p>
  <p>
    {" "}
    Knowing your data type and the number of varibales that you are visualising can
    help you to chose the most effective chart. Data can fall into the following
    categories:{" "}
  </p>
  <br />

</div>

<div className="container mx-auto">
  <p>
    {" "}
    In addition to the type of data, your choice of chart will also influenced by
    the <strong>story you are telling</strong> with your data. Often, such stories
    fall into the following four categories:{" "}
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Comparison: </strong> These stories allow the reader to visually
      compare two or more points of data.{" "}
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Deviation:</strong> These charts provide a visual representation
      of the variation of the data about a standard reference point.{" "}
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Distribution:</strong> These provide a visual summary of the
      frequency which values occur within a variable or dataset.{" "}
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Relationship:</strong> These stories focus on visualising the
      relationship or correlation between two or more variables.{" "}
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div className="container mx-auto">
  <p>
    {" "}
    You may want to tell more than one story with a single dataset. To demonstrate
    each of the four stories in action we can use the data collected for
    <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/">
      {" "}
      the World Happiness Report 2019
    </a>
    .{" "}
  </p>
  <p>
    {" "}
    If we wanted to <strong>compare</strong> the average happiness of continents,
    we might use a bar chart. A horizontal bar chart is a good choice for this, the
    orientation allows you to label each element on the y axis efficiently, without
    rotation. For maximum clarity, bars are ordered prior to plotting.{" "}
  </p>
  <br />

    alt="Average happiness score for each continent"
  ></img>
  <br />
  <p>
    {" "}
    We could also look at the <strong>deviation</strong> of each country in the Americas
    from the continent-wide average. A diverging bar chart is a good choice for this.
    In this instance the use of colour can accentuate positive and negative values.
  </p>
  <br />

    alt="Deviation from the mean happiness of the Americas"
  ></img>
  <br />
  <p>
    {" "}
    If we wanted to look at the <strong>relationship</strong> between two variables
    which contribute to the happiness of a country we could use a scatter plot. The
    examples below plot each countryâ€™s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita against
    the healthy life expectancy and the level of social support against the freedom
    to make life choices.{" "}
  </p>
  <br />

    src="./Relationship1.png"
    alt="GDP vs Healthly Life Expectancy, Social Support vs Freedom"
  ></img>
  <p>
    {" "}
    Finally, if we wanted to look at the distribution of global happiness we could
    use a histogram, histograms are one of the most common ways to represent the
    shape of a variable.{" "}
