# What is D3.js
**D3** stands for **Data-Driven Document** and **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)** is known as an open-source Javascript 
library that is capable of producing *web-based interactive data visualisations* 
in web browsers using **SVG**, **HTML** and **CSS**. It is powerful and customisable yet has 
a *steep learning curve*. If you are interested in online data visualisation or 
you have used many data visulisation libraries and want to DIY your own 
chart then give it a go!  
  
**[Mike Bostock](https://twitter.com/mbostock)** - the main author of **D3.js** also created an online platform called 
**[ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/)** where you can host your javascript notebooks (similar to how 
Jupyter Notebook works for Python) to explore and visualise your data. This 
platform is especially useful when you first start learning D3.js, as no 
installation is required to import D3 modules plus you can fork other people's 
notebook and build on top of it!  

<br/> 

# What you need to know 
Unlike programming languages such as **Python** and **R** that have some high-level 
libraries that allow you to draw interactive and informative graphics, 
D3.js gives you the freedom to build whatever you can imagine from 
low-levels. Although there are plenty of resources available online for you to 
learn D3.js, it is **recommended** you have some practical knowledge of following 
things before you proceed:  
  - **Javascript**
  - **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics)
  - **HTML5** (HyperText Markup Language)
  - **CSS** (Cascade Style Sheet)
    
**D3.js** is built from Javascript and no doubt you will need to know Javascript 
so that you will have no trouble dealing with data and functions. **SVG** is an 
XML-based vector graphics format and should always be the first and largest 
element of any D3 graphic you want to create. SVG acts as a container which 
allows you to draw any shapes within it using a set of basic shape elements 
such as rectangles, circles, ellipses, paths, straight lines, polylines, and 
polygons. D3 makes use of this mechanism which adds graphics and text to SVG 
and then binds data to those elements. An example of SVG:

```html:title=svg-example
<svg width="500" height="300">
   <rect x="0" y="0" width="300" height="200" fill="yellow"></rect>
</svg>
```

<svg width="500" height="300">
   <rect x="0" y="0" width="300" height="200" fill="yellow"></rect>
</svg>  
  
If you have ever had experience in creating web pages or similar then you should be 
familiar with HTML and CSS. HTML is the standard markup language for creating 
web pages as well as defining the structure of web pages, whereas HTML5 is the 
latest standard of HTML. CSS is the style language used for styling HTML documents 
and hence different websites have their presentation styles depending on how they 
define it.  
  
  

# Installation
To use D3.js you can either download the latest version 
from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org/) then include it in the head tag or place the 
following script within the head tag of your html file:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
```  
  


# Core Concepts
Rather than include everything (which are not possible) here, this article aims 
to give an introduction to the foundation of **D3** and let you discover other methods 
in the **[D3 API document](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md)** when needed. Note that this article is written based on D3 
version 5.16 and there might be some changes to D3 in the future which invalid 
some of the codes here.  

## Selections
One important aspect of D3 is the *DOM manipulation*. The 
**DOM** (Document Object Model) is an independent interface which organises an 
XML/HTML document into tree structure and each node within the tree represents 
a part of the document. Selection methods in D3 look similar to CSS 
selectors (actually it is based on CSS selectors) and allow you select elements 
within the DOM of the current web page then perform any other actions on it. There 
are two selection methods:  
  - **select()** - select the DOM element matched the given criteria within the 
  bracket. If there are more than one elements matched, only select the first 
  element. For example, *select("div")* will return the first div element in the 
  DOM tree, `select(".myclass")` return the first element that has the 
  class `myclass`.
  - **selectAll()** - similar to *select()* method but returns all elements that match 
  the criteria.  



But what could you do with **selected elements**? 

## New elements
  - **Append()** - allows you to modify the element or add new elements within 
  the selected element. For example, `d3.select("div").append("g")` add a `<g>` tag 
  element to the first div element (beware it doesnt change or replace existing 
  elements).
  
  ```html
  <div>
    <g></g>
  </div>
  ```

  - **text()** - set the content of the selected element



## Manipulation
  - **attr()** - Probably the most common methods used after the append method. This 
  method is used to add or update the specified attribute of the selected elements.
  - **style()** - Used to set the styles of the selected elements as how you would for 
  inline CSS styles. For example, `attr("background-color", "#000")` set the 
  background colour to black.
  - **html()** - Used to set the html content of selected elements, that means you can 
  actually write a html document within it! 

  ```js
  d3.select("svg")
    .html("<h1>Hello WOrld!</h1><p>My name is Dataviz!<p>")
  ```

  <div id="html"></div>

  - **insert()** - insert a new element at the end of selected elements.
  - **remove()** - delete selected elements.
  - **property()** - set attributes that cannot set by attr(), e.g your custom 
  attributes.
  - **classed()** - Set or modify the classlist of selected elements.

## Data-binding / data-join
Previously we have mentioned that we can draw shapes using basic shapes within 
SVG elements and indeed these basic shapes will have some required attributes to 
specify, for a rectangle you will need *height* and *width* and (*x*, *y*) coordinates. If 
you have multiple rectangles to create, then it would be a good idea to use some 
function and map attribute data to the shape, otherwise you will end up with 
multiple replicate lines. Rather than using a for loop, D3 have provided a useful 
method:  

```js
var data = [5,10,15,20,25]

svg.selectAll("rect")
    .data(data)
    .enter().append("rect")
    .attr("height", function(d,i) { return d; })
    .attr("width", "60")
    .attr("x", function(d,i) { return 40*i }
    .attr("y", function(d,i) { return 400-(d*10); })
```

To bind the data, you need to use `data()` methods with your data. But what is 
the `enter()` method and why do we append rectangles after we have already selected 
rectangle elements? Consider the scenario that there are no rectangles for we 
to select, so `svg.selectAll("rect")` will just return an empty selection, this 
means data has not bound to any elements, and what `enter()` methods does is select 
these unbound data, then `.append("rect")` will append a rectangle element to each 
of these data elements. The same procedure applies to the case when the number 
of rectangles is less than the number of data objects. In the case of more 
rectangles than data objects, then instead of `.enter().append("rect")` 
we use `.exit().remove()` to remove any unused rectangles.  
  
If you only want to bind data to a single element and does not require any 
updates then you can also use the `datum()` method.



## Dynamic properties
In the data binding section we have code look like this:

```js
svg.selectAll("rect")
    .data(data)
    .enter().append("rect")
    .attr("height", function(d,i) { return d; })
```

In the height attribute of each rectangle, instead of a value, we assign a function 
to it which returns `d`. The `d` and `i` here refers to the corresponding **data point**
and **index** of the current rectangle. This means we can pass data dynamically to 
each element and assign attributes at your will. You can call `d` and `i` whatever 
you want but **the order is important**. Even if you use `i` only, `d` must be specified 
because the index is always the **second parameter** in the function. 



## Events
As in vanilla javascript, D3.js also allows you to bind an event listener to any 
DOM element using d3.selection.on() method which can capture event types you 
would normally use. Here is a simple example that the text colour will change 
once you are hovering it:  

```js
d3.select("#event")
  .style("padding", "3rem 2rem")
	.on("mouseover", function() {
		d3.select(this)
			.style("background-color", "black")
      .style("color", "white");
	})
	.on("mouseout", function() {
		d3.select(this)
      .style("background-color", "yellow")
      .style("color", "black")
	});
```

<div id="event" className="text-2xl font-bold" style={{fontFamily: 'ink Free'}}>D3.js for data visualisation</div>

# A simple example
Let's use 2020 world population data to create an interactive world map that 
displays each country's population and growth rate.  

The first step is to create a `svg` element and a `div` element with *tooltip* class 
in your html file:

```html
<svg id="worldMap" style="min-width: 80vw; min-height: 60vh"></svg>
<div className="tooltip"></div>
```
We also need to add styles for the *tooltip* class and *hiddenTt* class (appears later):

```css
div.tooltip {
  color: #222; 
  background: #fff; 
  border-radius: 3px; 
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px 0px #a6a6a6; 
  padding: .5em; 
  text-shadow: #f5f5f5 0 1px 0;
  opacity: 0.9; 
  position: absolute;
}
.hiddenTt {
  display: none;
}
```

Then define the population dataset and geographic locations for 
each country.

```js:title=dataviz.js
countryCoor = "https://unpkg.com/world-atlas@1/world/110m.json"
countryNames = "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lkopacz/dfd9cc04a4d5a5f0fe87c89a79524479/raw/39100d4f6b7c784bd5d838a4e357873ef6877579/world-country-names.csv"
populationData = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yld-weng/datasets/master/CC0-PublicDomain/world_population2020.csv"
```

The next step is to create a projection that transforms **latitude** and **longitude** 
coordinates into **x** and **y** coordinates which can be used to display on our 
screen. Then we create a geographic path generator using the projection. 
Notice that we have appended the `g` tag to the `svg` element, so that we can 
append all paths to `g` later. This ensures all paths are grouped for better 
code management and visibility.  

```js:title=Create_Projection
var projection = d3.geoNaturalEarth1();
var path = d3.geoPath()
              .projection(projection);
var svg = d3.select("#worldMap")
              .append("g")
              .attr("position", "center");
var tooltip = d3.select("div.tooltip");
```  

To load datasets we are using D3 functions `d3.json` and `d3.csv`, and the use of 
*Promise* is to ensure we do not perform any actions until data are loaded successfully. 
The *createMap* function is the function we have created to produce the actual map.

```js:title=Promise {6}
Promise.all([
	d3.json(countryCoor),
	d3.csv(countryNames),
	d3.csv(populationData)
]).then(data => {
		createMap(data[0], data[1], data[2])
}).catch(err => {
		throw err;
})
```

Let's go through the `createMap` function in more details. Before drawing the map we need 
to make sure we have the right data structure. The first step is to get **GeoJSON** 
features (geometry coordinates of each country's border) by using **TopoJSON** functions.  
Read more about **TopoJSON** on:
<LPWrap>
  <LPItem href="https://github.com/topojson/topojson-client/blob/master/README.md#feature">
    TopoJSON API

</LPWrap>

However, the *countryCoor* dataset contains only country ids rather than the country 
names. Therefore, we join the dataset with the *countryNames* dataset and return 
the country name if there is a match on id. Similarly, we join with 
the *populationData* dataset to get the population and yearly change rate for each 
country.

```js:title=Create_map_function
function createMap(world, names, population) {
	var countriesData = topojson.feature(world, world.objects.countries).features;
	countries = countriesData.filter(d => {
		return names.some(n => {
			if (d.id == n.id) return d.name = n.name;
		})
	});
	countries = countries.filter(d => {
		return population.some(function(p) {
			name1 = d.name;
			name2 = p.Region;
			if(name1.includes(name2)) {
				d.population = p.Population;
				return d.Yearly_Change = p.Yearly_Change
			}
		})
  })
 ...
}
```

Now we move on to create the map. If you have read the section above then you should find the following code familiar:

```js:title=Create_map_function
function createMap(world, names, population) {
  ...
  svg.selectAll("path")
      .data(countries)
      .enter()
      .append("path")
      .attr("stroke","#313131")
      .attr("stroke-width",1)
      .attr("fill", "#535353")
      .attr("d", path)
      .on("mouseover",function(d,i){
        d3.select(this).attr("fill","#00b2ec").attr("stroke-width",2);
        return tooltip.style("hidden", false).html(d.name + "<br/>" + d.population);
      })
      .on("mousemove",function(d){
        tooltip.classed("hiddenTt", false)
                .style("top", (d3.event.pageY + -460) + "px")
                .style("left", (d3.event.pageX + 10) + "px")
                .html(d.name + "<br/>" + "<p style='font-size: 13px'>Population: " + d.population + "</p><p style='font-size: 13px; margin-top: -10px'>Yearly change: " + d.Yearly_Change + "</p>");
      })
      .on("mouseout",function(d,i){
        d3.select(this).attr("fill","#535353").attr("stroke-width",1);
        tooltip.classed("hiddenTt", true);
      });
  ...
}
```

In here we are creating paths using data from above then add three events monitoring 
user's mouse movement on the map.  

Lastly, we can make the map more interactive by monitoring user's dragging action and 
rotate/translate the map accordingly.

```js:title=Monitor-User-Action
function createMap(world, names, population) {
  ...
	svg.call(d3.drag()
    .on("drag", function() {
      var xy = d3.mouse(this);
      projection.rotate(xy).translate([xy[0], xy[1]])
      svg.selectAll("path")
        .attr("d",path);
    }));
```

<svg id="d3" className="lg:-ml-60 md:min-w-80 md:min-h-60 lg:min-h-60"></svg>
<div className="tooltip"></div>
