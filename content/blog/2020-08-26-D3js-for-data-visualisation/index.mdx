# What is D3.js

**D3** stands for **Data-Driven Document** and **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)** is known as an open-source Javascript
library that is capable of producing _web-based interactive data visualisations_
in web browsers using **SVG**, **HTML** and **CSS**. It is powerful and customisable yet has
a _steep learning curve_. If you are interested in online data visualisation or
you have used many data visulisation libraries and want to DIY your own
chart then give it a go!

**[Mike Bostock](https://twitter.com/mbostock)** - the main author of **D3.js** also created an online platform called
**[ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/)** where you can host your javascript notebooks (similar to how
Jupyter Notebook works for Python) to explore and visualise your data. This
platform is especially useful when you first start learning D3.js, as no
installation is required to import D3 modules plus you can fork other people's
notebook and build on top of it!

<br />{" "}

# What you need to know

Unlike programming languages such as **Python** and **R** that have some high-level
libraries that allow you to draw interactive and informative graphics,
D3.js gives you the freedom to build whatever you can imagine from
low-levels. Although there are plenty of resources available online for you to
learn D3.js, it is **recommended** you have some practical knowledge of following
things before you proceed:

- **Javascript**
- **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- **HTML5** (HyperText Markup Language)
- **CSS** (Cascade Style Sheet)

**D3.js** is built from Javascript and no doubt you will need to know Javascript
so that you will have no trouble dealing with data and functions. **SVG** is an
XML-based vector graphics format and should always be the first and largest
element of any D3 graphic you want to create. SVG acts as a container which
allows you to draw any shapes within it using a set of basic shape elements
such as rectangles, circles, ellipses, paths, straight lines, polylines, and
polygons. D3 makes use of this mechanism which adds graphics and text to SVG
and then binds data to those elements. An example of SVG:

```html:title=svg-example
<svg width="500" height="300">
   <rect x="0" y="0" width="300" height="200" fill="yellow"></rect>
</svg>
```

<svg width="500" height="300">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="300" height="200" fill="yellow"></rect>
</svg>
If you have ever had experience in creating web pages or similar then you should
be familiar with HTML and CSS. HTML is the standard markup language for creating
web pages as well as defining the structure of web pages, whereas HTML5 is the latest
standard of HTML. CSS is the style language used for styling HTML documents and hence
different websites have their presentation styles depending on how they define it.

# Installation

To use D3.js you can either download the latest version
from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org/) then include it in the head tag or place the
following script within the head tag of your html file:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
```

# Core Concepts

Rather than include everything (which are not possible) here, this article aims
to give an introduction to the foundation of **D3** and let you discover other methods
in the **[D3 API document](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md)** when needed. Note that this article is written based on D3
version 5.16 and there might be some changes to D3 in the future which invalid
some of the codes here.

## Selections

One important aspect of D3 is the _DOM manipulation_. The
**DOM** (Document Object Model) is an independent interface which organises an
XML/HTML document into tree structure and each node within the tree represents
a part of the document. Selection methods in D3 look similar to CSS
selectors (actually it is based on CSS selectors) and allow you select elements
within the DOM of the current web page then perform any other actions on it. There
are two selection methods:

- **select()** - select the DOM element matched the given criteria within the
  bracket. If there are more than one elements matched, only select the first
  element. For example, _select("div")_ will return the first div element in the
  DOM tree, `select(".myclass")` return the first element that has the
  class `myclass`.
- **selectAll()** - similar to _select()_ method but returns all elements that match
  the criteria.

But what could you do with **selected elements**?

## New elements

- **Append()** - allows you to modify the element or add new elements within
  the selected element. For example, `d3.select("div").append("g")` add a `<g>` tag
  element to the first div element (beware it doesnt change or replace existing
  elements).

```html
<div>
  <g></g>
</div>
```

- **text()** - set the content of the selected element

## Manipulation

- **attr()** - Probably the most common methods used after the append method. This
  method is used to add or update the specified attribute of the selected elements.
- **style()** - Used to set the styles of the selected elements as how you would for
  inline CSS styles. For example, `attr("background-color", "#000")` set the
  background colour to black.
- **html()** - Used to set the html content of selected elements, that means you can
  actually write a html document within it!

```js
d3.select("svg").html("<h1>Hello WOrld!</h1><p>My name is Dataviz!<p>");
```

{" "}
<div id="html"></div>

- **insert()** - insert a new element at the end of selected elements.
- **remove()** - delete selected elements.
- **property()** - set attributes that cannot set by attr(), e.g your custom
  attributes.
- **classed()** - Set or modify the classlist of selected elements.

## Data-binding / data-join

Previously we have mentioned that we can draw shapes using basic shapes within
SVG elements and indeed these basic shapes will have some required attributes to
specify, for a rectangle you will need _height_ and _width_ and (_x_, _y_) coordinates. If
you have multiple rectangles to create, then it would be a good idea to use some
function and map attribute data to the shape, otherwise you will end up with
multiple replicate lines. Rather than using a for loop, D3 have provided a useful
method:

```js
let data = [5,10,15,20,25]

svg.selectAll("rect")
    .data(data)
    .enter().append("rect")
    .attr("height", function(d,i) { return d; })
    .attr("width", "60")
    .attr("x", function(d,i) { return 40*i }
    .attr("y", function(d,i) { return 400-(d*10); })
```

To bind the data, you need to use `data()` methods with your data. But what is
the `enter()` method and why do we append rectangles after we have already selected
rectangle elements? Consider the scenario that there are no rectangles for we
to select, so `svg.selectAll("rect")` will just return an empty selection, this
means data has not bound to any elements, and what `enter()` methods does is select
these unbound data, then `.append("rect")` will append a rectangle element to each
of these data elements. The same procedure applies to the case when the number
of rectangles is less than the number of data objects. In the case of more
rectangles than data objects, then instead of `.enter().append("rect")`
we use `.exit().remove()` to remove any unused rectangles.

If you only want to bind data to a single element and does not require any
updates then you can also use the `datum()` method.

## Dynamic properties

In the data binding section we have code look like this:

```js
svg
  .selectAll("rect")
  .data(data)
  .enter()
  .append("rect")
  .attr("height", function (d, i) {
    return d;
  });
```

In the height attribute of each rectangle, instead of a value, we assign a function
to it which returns `d`. The `d` and `i` here refers to the corresponding **data point**
and **index** of the current rectangle. This means we can pass data dynamically to
each element and assign attributes at your will. You can call `d` and `i` whatever
you want but **the order is important**. Even if you use `i` only, `d` must be specified
because the index is always the **second parameter** in the function.

## Events

As in vanilla javascript, D3.js also allows you to bind an event listener to any
DOM element using d3.selection.on() method which can capture event types you
would normally use. Here is a simple example that the text colour will change
once you are hovering it:

```js
d3.select("#event")
  .style("padding", "3rem 2rem")
  .on("mouseover", function () {
    d3.select(this).style("background-color", "black").style("color", "white");
  })
  .on("mouseout", function () {
    d3.select(this).style("background-color", "yellow").style("color", "black");
  });
```

<div
  id="event"
  className="text-2xl font-bold"
  style={{ fontFamily: "ink Free" }}
>

# A simple example

Let's use 2020 world population data to create an interactive world map that
displays each country's population and growth rate.

The first step is to create a `svg` element and a `div` element with _tooltip_ class
in your html file:

```html
<svg id="worldMap" style="min-width: 80vw; min-height: 60vh"></svg>
<div className="tooltip"></div>
```

We also need to add styles for the _tooltip_ class and _hiddenTt_ class (appears later):

```css
div.tooltip {
  color: #222;
  background: #fff;
  border-radius: 3px;
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px 0px #a6a6a6;
  padding: 0.5em;
  text-shadow: #f5f5f5 0 1px 0;
  opacity: 0.9;
  position: absolute;
}
.hiddenTt {
  display: none;
}
```

Then define the population dataset and geographic locations for
each country.

```js:title=dataviz.js
countryCoor = "https://unpkg.com/world-atlas@1/world/110m.json"
countryNames = "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lkopacz/dfd9cc04a4d5a5f0fe87c89a79524479/raw/39100d4f6b7c784bd5d838a4e357873ef6877579/world-country-names.csv"
populationData = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yld-weng/datasets/master/CC0-PublicDomain/world_population2020.csv"
```

The next step is to create a projection that transforms **latitude** and **longitude**
coordinates into **x** and **y** coordinates which can be used to display on our
screen. Then we create a geographic path generator using the projection.
Notice that we have appended the `g` tag to the `svg` element, so that we can
append all paths to `g` later. This ensures all paths are grouped for better
code management and visibility.

```js:title=Create_Projection
let projection = d3.geoNaturalEarth1();
let path = d3.geoPath()
              .projection(projection);
let svg = d3.select("#worldMap")
              .append("g")
              .attr("position", "center");
let tooltip = d3.select("div.tooltip");
```

To load datasets we are using D3 functions `d3.json` and `d3.csv`, and the use of
_Promise_ is to ensure we do not perform any actions until data are loaded successfully.
The _createMap_ function is the function we have created to produce the actual map.

```js:title=Promise {6}
Promise.all([
	d3.json(countryCoor),
	d3.csv(countryNames),
	d3.csv(populationData)
]).then(data => {
		createMap(data[0], data[1], data[2])
}).catch(err => {
		throw err;
})
```

Let's go through the `createMap` function in more details. Before drawing the map we need
to make sure we have the right data structure. The first step is to get **GeoJSON**
features (geometry coordinates of each country's border) by using **TopoJSON** functions.  
Read more about **TopoJSON** on:

<LPWrap>
  <LPItem href="https://github.com/topojson/topojson-client/blob/master/README.md#feature">
    TopoJSON API

</LPWrap>

However, the _countryCoor_ dataset contains only country ids rather than the country
names. Therefore, we join the dataset with the _countryNames_ dataset and return
the country name if there is a match on id. Similarly, we join with
the _populationData_ dataset to get the population and yearly change rate for each
country.

```js:title=Create_map_function
function createMap(world, names, population) {
	let countriesData = topojson.feature(world, world.objects.countries).features;
	countries = countriesData.filter(d => {
		return names.some(n => {
			if (d.id == n.id) return d.name = n.name;
		})
	});
	countries = countries.filter(d => {
		return population.some(function(p) {
			name1 = d.name;
			name2 = p.Region;
			if(name1.includes(name2)) {
				d.population = p.Population;
				return d.Yearly_Change = p.Yearly_Change
			}
		})
  })
 ...
}
```

Now we move on to create the map. If you have read the section above then you should find the following code familiar:

```js:title=Create_map_function
function createMap(world, names, population) {
  ...
  svg.selectAll("path")
      .data(countries)
      .enter()
      .append("path")
      .attr("stroke","#313131")
      .attr("stroke-width",1)
      .attr("fill", "#535353")
      .attr("d", path)
      .on("mouseover",function(d,i){
        d3.select(this).attr("fill","#00b2ec").attr("stroke-width",2);
        return tooltip.style("hidden", false).html(d.name + "<br/>" + d.population);
      })
      .on("mousemove",function(d){
        tooltip.classed("hiddenTt", false)
                .style("top", (d3.event.pageY + -460) + "px")
                .style("left", (d3.event.pageX + 10) + "px")
                .html(d.name + "<br/>" + "<p style='font-size: 13px'>Population: " + d.population + "</p><p style='font-size: 13px; margin-top: -10px'>Yearly change: " + d.Yearly_Change + "</p>");
      })
      .on("mouseout",function(d,i){
        d3.select(this).attr("fill","#535353").attr("stroke-width",1);
        tooltip.classed("hiddenTt", true);
      });
  ...
}
```

In here we are creating paths using data from above then add three events monitoring
user's mouse movement on the map.

Lastly, we can make the map more interactive by monitoring user's dragging action and
rotate/translate the map accordingly.

```js:title=Monitor-User-Action
function createMap(world, names, population) {
  ...
	svg.call(d3.drag()
    .on("drag", function() {
      let xy = d3.mouse(this);
      projection.rotate(xy).translate([xy[0], xy[1]])
      svg.selectAll("path")
        .attr("d",path);
    }));
```

<svg id="d3" className="lg:-ml-60 md:min-w-80 md:min-h-60 lg:min-h-60"></svg>
<div className="tooltip"></div>
