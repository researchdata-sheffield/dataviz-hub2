## Some good practice guidelines
There is a lot of readily available advice aiming to help us improve our plots and avoid common pitfalls. Seminal work from Edward Tufte and John Tukey are excellent places to look for guidance. As well as a plethora of modern examples including; [from Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/), [Cynthia Brewer's](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) work on colour, [Bang Wong's](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth0211-101) points of view series for Nature Methods and of course, the work of [Jeffery Heer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/). With so much excellent advice out there, what I hope to do with this blog is synthesise some of the more common issues that may face you when creating data visualisations. I'll work them into a case study to demonstrate the positive effect of making multiple small changes. 

The case study is a simple example showing the average number of books loaned each day from four different libraries. The data, along with the libraries, are fictional. As you can see the bar chart is very striking. However, the detail is obscured by the design choices. Readers will have to spend longer than necessary to digest the message that I'm presenting in this graph. Often, it leaves you wondering if there's something that you've missed.

I will discuss some steps that I can take to make this graphic much more fit-for-purpose. As I work through these changes, I'll keep in mind that often, the most effective visualisations are **clear**, **simple** and **intentional**.
- **Clear:** Data visualisations are used to inform. If they are overly complicated or unfamiliar to the target audience then they are not fit for purpose.
- **Simple:** Good design lets the data do the talking.
- **Intentional:** Data visualisations portray a message. What that message is should be clear before creating the visualisation.

I can summarise the changes I make to this graph in 11 steps, they are as follows:

## Step 1: Removing the 3D effects 

![Step 1](./Step_1.png)

It's quite rare nowadays to see many authors using a 3D effect such as the one shown in my example. Studies on graphical perception have demonstrated that volume is susceptible to misinterpretation (Cleaveland and McGill, 1984). By simply removing the 3-dimensional effect, the reader is relying on the height of the bar as opposed to volume. Also, like me, you may find the relationship between the four bars becomes more pronounced. 

To be clear, what we are discussing here is the removal of gratuitous 3D effects. In this instance, the 3rd dimension adds nothing to the message that we are portraying with the chart. 
This is not to say the 3-dimensional plotting has no place in modern data visualisation, in fact, 3-dimensional plots can be engaging and informative if used in the right context. 
Think of [Matlab](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/surf.html) and [Python's](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/mplot3d/surface3d.html#sphx-glr-gallery-mplot3d-surface3d-py) surface plots 
or R's [plot3d package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plot3D/vignettes/plot3D.pdf). Perhaps even more exciting, think of data visualisations in augmented or virtual reality!

## Step 2: Make the bars equal width

![Step 2](./Step_2.png)

We know that this bar chart intends to show the average number of books loaned from each library per day. 
That's all. This information is represented by the height of the bar, therefore, the unequal widths are an unnecessary addition to the chart. 
Instead of accentuating our point, they may even be detracting from the overall message, by implying that there is something else being shown here that the reader should take note of. 
Making the bars an equal width is a fast and effective way to make bar charts clear (Bigwood and Spore, 2013).

## Step 3: Remove the gradient fill 

![Step 3](./Step_3.png)

This is a very similar situation to Step 4. Gradient fills implicitly imply that there is a change in value to be noted. 
Think of when we typically see colour gradients used in data visualisation; in a [choropleth](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/choropleth.html) or a [heatmap](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/heatmap.html). 
When we use gradient fills, or pattern fills unnecessarily we are unconsciously complicating our graph and forcing our reader to waste time looking at something other than so the height of the bar.

## Step 4: Remove the colour altogether

![Step 4](./Step_4.png)

It is quite common to see unnecessary colour on graphs, especially simple ones like these that could be considered a little boring without it. 
However, we need to remember that good data viz lets the data speak for itself. 
When introducing colour to a data visualisation it's often useful to pause and question whether it is adding anything to our message, if not, 
it may in fact [do more harm than good!](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-pitfalls.html)

## Step 5: Remove the legend

![Step 5](./Step_5.png)


Now that we have removed the unnecessary colour, it's quite clear that we no longer need the legend. 
This is a crucial thing to consider when drawing your graphs, many of us quite familiar with seeing a legend, so we sometimes forget to question whether 
we actually need it, or whether it's just an item cluttering our figure. In this case, each of our variables are labelled on the X-axis. We know what each bar represents. 

If you look at the figure with the legend and the figure without, you may find your eye tracking around the graph far less, 
spending more time on the bars; the data.  In fact, you may find that it is becoming increasingly common, to see data visualisations avoiding legends altogether by labelling elements directly. 
This is particularly common in [media](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/#make_changes_to_the_legend) and [government statistical departments.](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/data-visualisation/titles-and-text/) 

## Step 6: Text

![Step 6](./Step_6.png)


There are a few things to address with the text on this graph, perhaps the most striking is the font. It's quite easy to get swept up in the fine details when searching for the best font for your data visualisation. Serif or Sans Serif?, Lining or old style?, Tabular or proportional?, there's [a lot to consider](https://medium.com/nightingale/choosing-a-font-for-your-data-visualization-2ed37afea637#:~:text=Font%20used%3A%20Lato%20is%20a,but%20not%20distorted%2C%20letter%20spacing). However, unless it is of particular interest to you, I think it's important to not get too bogged down in these debates. On a fundamental level, the font *"must draw our attention before it is read but not interfere with reading"* Bang Wong (2011). This leaves some room for personal taste but ensures that text is not uncomfortable, as it is in our 'before' graph.

There are two other issues with the font on this chart that need addressing. The y axis label and the x tick labels. The Y-axis label on our original chart read as "n.b". Very unhelpful. With a little deductive prowess, we may be able to discern that this stands for "number of books", however, it's not immediately obvious. If you're using labels, make sure they are clear. 

The final issue is those rotated x tick labels. We can spare our readers having to crane their necks by simply rotating these back to horizontal. If the length of the x tick labels and/or the number of bars prohibits this simple fix then I would recommend switching to a horizontal bar chart. You may note that I'm being hypocritical here as my y-axis label is still rotated. This is a personal preference; I find that the white space generated above and below a horizontal y-axis label is too much waste for my liking, I'd rather maximise the size of the axes.

## Step 7: Order the bars

![Step 7](./Step_7.png)


When using bar charts its good practice to place the bars in size order. Doing so effectively highlights the relationship between each of the bars. It's also excellent for detecting outliers. From Data to Viz have an excellent summary of the impact of [ordering data](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/order_data.html). Of course, it's important to note that this is only the case for variables that have no logical order. If you're working with data in an existing order, such as frequency of responses to a Likert scale or time-series data, then the order should be preserved. 

## Step 8: Remove gridlines

![Step 8](./Step_8.png)

There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to whether or not to include gridlines in a chart. Of course, gridlines can provide visual assistance, helping the reader to get a better understanding of the data behind the image. However, often when we visualise our data, what we are portraying is less about the exact numbers, more about the relationship between them. When considering gridlines in this context, they can actually detract from our ability to see the data as a whole. I've chosen not to use gridlines in this example, There are just four bars, we're working with whole numbers and the difference between those numbers is not large, therefore, the gridlines provide little visual assistance. 

It is important when considering gridlines to understand what it is you want to achieve with your chart. Experiment with your visualisations. But do remember, if gridlines are the best option for your figure, then be sure to soften them. [Claus Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/balance-data-context.html#background-grids), has some excellent advice about when to use gridlines and how to soften them if you do choose to use them. 

## Step 9: Remove data labels

![Step 9](./Step_9.png)


In step 9, I've chosen to remove the data labels on the bars. The alternative could be to remove the y-axis altogether and maintain the data labels. This chart has few variables, therefore, by directly labelling the bars readers could quickly digest the data behind the visualisation. However, my personal preference has again come to the fore; I've chosen to keep the y-axis. My reason behind this choice is that simple plots like these are likely to appear throughout a scientific paper or report. By maintaining a typical x and y-axis in simple charts, they can feel more consistent with later charts, specifically, more complex ones where x and y-axis are essential.  

A bit of food for thought there, I'd like to highlight that it's important to think about your design choices, each of your decisions should be conscious ones.  

## Step 10: Y-axis Scale

![Step 10](./Step_10.png)

Until this point, we have focussed a lot on the clarity of the graph and making it easier to digest the message. Step 10, the scale on the y axis, is a little different, in fact, it's an example of how we might lie, intentionally or otherwise, with graphs. When a reader glances at the graph, they may assume the library in Namek is used considerably less by the public than the library in Republic City. the graph gives the impression that for every book withdrawn in Namek, 8 more are withdrawn from Republic City. This is in fact, untrue. It has been exaggerated by the chosen limits of the y-axis. When we correct this we can see that there is a far smaller difference between the four libraries. 

An excellent TEDed talk by Lea Gaslowitz covers the concept of stretching the truth a little too far, inadvertently or otherwise with our y-axis. I highly recommend watching it.

Cutting the Y-axis is a very contentious debate in data visualisation, see [this page](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/cut_y_axis.html) and the links therein. It is because of the opportunity it offers to mislead readers. For this chart and typically for all bar charts, you should start your axis at zero. This is because bar charts typically represent quantities or parts of a whole. There are very few exceptions to this. The same is not true for other charts, as Lea Gaslowitz shows, it is just as likely to be misled by a cut axis as an uncut one. So it's not a suitable answer to always start your charts at 0. You must take control of your y-axis scale. If it's necessary to fight with your software's default settings to achieve this, then do. If you do choose to cut, then make this abundantly clear to your readers. 

## Step 11: Add a detailed figure caption

![Step 11](./Step_11.png)


Finally, all charts should have an informative title or a figure caption. I've chosen to use a figure caption for this chart as I envisage it in a paper or a report. The figure caption typically describes what it is the reader is looking at and can offer some further information about the data that helps the reader grasp the message of the visualisation.


## Final notes
This is a very exaggerated example of 'bad-to-good' DataViz. I hope that is has still been useful. You may have noted there are some areas where the good practice guidance is a little grey. These are areas where you can explore your own style. You may find Data visualisation referred to as art.
