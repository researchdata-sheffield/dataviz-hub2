What role do data visualizations play in people’s understanding of the world? This
is an important question for folks who dedicate time and energy to making data visualizations.
Developing skills to make good data visualizations is important, but if we don’t
stop to think about the people who engage with them, visualizations may not have
the impact that their producers intend. Data visualization has effects. It plays
a social role. We need to research its role and effects, in order to deploy it wisely.
This is true of data visualizations produced by researchers for expert audiences,
as well as datavis aimed at the public and circulated in news media.{" "}

I have been researching the social role of data visualizations since 2013. I was working on a research project exploring
how resource-poor public sector organisations were engaging with social media data, when I was struck by the visceral ways
in which collaborators responded to visual representations of said data. Without taking the time to make sense of the data
visualizations included in a report that the research team produced, one collaborator told us that he loved them, and he
wanted more. This set me off on a path researching how people engage with data visualizations, the role that emotions in
these engagements, and the consequences, or effects, of engaging with data visualizations.

My first project was **[Seeing Data](https://seeingdata.org/)**, which ran from 2014 to 2015 and was funded by the AHRC.
Working with [Visualising Data](https://visualisingdata.com) and the [Migration Observatory](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/) at
the University of Oxford, on Seeing Data, we explored how people make sense of data visualizations. We found that a range
of factors affect engagements with data visualizations, including subject matter, source/original location, beliefs and
opinions, time, emotions, confidence and skills. We [concluded](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/6389) that
as a result of what we found, more comprehensive definitions of what constitutes effectiveness were needed in relation to datavis (Kennedy et al 2016). We
were struck by the important role than [emotions](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038038516674675) play in
people’s engagements with datavis – this was noteworthy, we thought, because data are often assumed to be scientific and objective
and so require reasoning to make sense of them (Kennedy and Hill 2018). In fact, most people encounter data in visual form, and this stirs up emotions.

The work we started on Seeing Data is continued by three excellent PhD students on an ESRC PhD Network
called **[Relating to Data through Visualization](https://seeingdata.org/relating-data-visualisation/)**. Jill Simpson is
researching the meaning-making processes at work when people interpret dataviz. Lulu Pinney is researching data
visualization literacy. And last but not least, Arron Ridley is exploring approaches to dataviz evaluation that
capture the diversity of populations.

From 2016 to 2019, I participated on a project funded by the Norwegian Research Council called **[INDVIL](https://indvil.org/)**, or
**Innovative Data Visualization and Visual Numeric Literacy**, which explored data visualization as a semiotic,
aesthetic and discursive resource in society. A major output from INDVIL
is _[Data Visualization In Society](https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789463722902/data-visualization-in-society)_, a
collection I co-edited with Martin Engebretsen, with chapters from the INDVIL team and many others. This book
is open access (from Amsterdam University Press) and as such is a great resource for folks teaching about dataviz
in society.

From October 2020, I will be working on a project called **[Generic Visuals in The News: the role of stock photos
and simple data visualizations in assembling publics](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT000015%2F1)**, with collaborators
from the University of Leeds. Funded by the AHRC, Generic Visuals investigates the role that everyday images in the news
play in bringing publics together, building the public sphere and in facilitating democratic processes. On this project,
we will compare simple data visualizations with stock photos. We call these images ‘generic visuals’, because they have
standardized formats and appearances and perform particular design functions, and in order to engage with research
that has emphasized the increasing importance of generic-ness in journalism aesthetics.

Visual imagery permeates the news: journalism and other forms of digital information dissemination are visual.
In the limited research which acknowledges the significance of visuals in the news, analyses prioritise arresting,
individualized and iconic images and how they activate citizens to care or not care about particular issues. Recent
studies of increasingly ubiquitous data visualizations in the news have likewise focused on those that are award-winning
or considered beautiful. Yet what we call ‘generic visuals’ populate journalism and other information sources today,
off and online, across mobile apps and other digital platforms. Given their ubiquity, it is vital that we understand
the roles that these generic visual forms play in assembling publics. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to develop
understanding of the role that generic visuals play in assembling publics, in building the public sphere(s) and in
facilitating democratic processes. Watch this space for more about our project in the coming years.
