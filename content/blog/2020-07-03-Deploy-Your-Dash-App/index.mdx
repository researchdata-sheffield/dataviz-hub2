*It is exciting to see your beautiful dash app running locally, but it would be even more interesting if 
    others can interact with it over the web too!*

## 1. Introduction
This documentation assumes some prior knowledge of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and HTML/CSS. A minimum of being able to install Python, packages, and be able to execute code should 
get you a example visualisation. If you need assistance with Python, [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) provides documentation and tutorials.

In this documentation you will see the app that was built in **<Link to="/blog/12/06/2020/dash-tutorial-2">Dash tutorial</Link>** 
deployed onto an online cloud platform - **Heroku**, step by step. Although there are other providers you can choose from
such as **Microsoft Azure** and **Amazon Web Services**, but **Heroku** offering a free plan which is sufficient for most of us. 
If you do require more scaled solutions, check out their websites. 

If you simply want to share your Jupyter Notebook, find out options 
at **<Link to="/blog/24/06/2020/host-jupyter-notebook">Host Jupyter Notebook</Link>**. 

My codes for the app can be found [here](https://github.com/researchdata-sheffield/dash_widgets), 
and my dash app is published as **[dash-widgets](https://dash-widgets.herokuapp.com)**.

<br />

## 2. Installation
To host a dash app with Heroku, you'll need the following (at minimum):
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
 - [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/)
 - [Heroku Command Line](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/command-line)
 - [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)

If you're using Jupyter notebook you'll need to change the extension **.ipynb** to **.py**. To do this, install 
*nbconvert* use the command `pip install nbconvert`,then `jupyter nbconvert --to script app.ipynb` 
for conversion. 

<br />

## 3. Initialisation
Nagivates to the folder where your dash app located, and initialise the folder:
```shell
git init                  # initialises an git repo at current directory
virtualenv venv           # creates an virtual environment called "venv"
source venv/bin/activate  # enter the virtual environment
```
If you're using Windows, use `source venv/Scripts/activate` instead for the last command. If you close the 
terminal then you'll need to re-enter this command to activate virtualenv. Since this is a fresh environment 
we have to re-install dependencies, this depends on what packages you're using. My packages: 
```shell
pip install dash
pip install plotly
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install gunicorn # you have to install this to deploy the app
```

<br />  

Now add three addition files **Procfile**, **.gitignore**, and **requirements.txt** to app's directory.  

---

**Procfile** (without any file extension):
```procfile
web: gunicorn app:server
```
*NOTE: app and server refers to the python file `app.py`'s filename and server variable*:
```python
app = dash.Dash(__name__)
server = app.server
```
You can change them to whatever you like.

---

**.gitignore** (prevent git upload files listed in this file):
```git
venv
*.pyc
.DS_Store
.env
```

<br />

---

**requirements.txt** (specify dependencies for your environment), use the following command to generate this file 
automatically:
```shell
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

<br />

## 4. Deployment
To continue, make sure you've installed [Heroku Command Line](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/command-line). 
First create a named heroku app:
```shell
heroku create your-app-name
```
*If this is the first time you use the heroku CLI then it will ask you for username and password.*  
Then push your directory to heroku:
```shell
git add .
git commit -m 'My dash app'
git push heroku master
```
If you're using Windows and encountering a similar message *'No matching distribution found for pywin32=323'* 
when push to heroku, then go to the *requirements.txt* and delete the line **pywin32=323**, this should 
resolve the issue and you can execute `git push heroku master` again.  
Last step, run the heroku app on web:
```shell
heroku ps:scale web=1
```
Type `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com` in your browser and hit enter should get you to your first web 
dash app!  
  
Whenever you've made changes to your **.py** file, you'll need to repeat commands from `git add .` onward to 
update the app.
