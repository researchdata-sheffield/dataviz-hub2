Once you have setup a website using React, go ahead to install the React Flow library and styled-components (I'm using this to achieve locally scoped CSS). Then import the flowchart using the following code: <br/><code>import FlowChart from "./flowChart/flowChart"<br/>import { ReactFlowProvider } from 'react-flow-renderer'</code>`
