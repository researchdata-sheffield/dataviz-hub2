title: "Improved rice cooking approach to maximise arsenic removal while preserving nutrient elements"
thumbnail: thumb.jpg
description: The parboiled and absorbed (PBA) method removed 54% & 73% inorganic arsenic (iAs) from brown & white rice. The PBA method raised margin of exposure (MOE) by 3.7 and 2.2 times for white and brown rice, respectively. Read the paper for this method's graphical abstract and step by step guide.
