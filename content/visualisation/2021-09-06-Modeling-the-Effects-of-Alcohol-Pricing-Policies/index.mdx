description: |
  A sunburst visualisation that shows modelled effects of tax and minimum unit pricing (MUP) policies on Consumption (units per year), Expenditure (annual £ spent), and Hospitalisations (at full effect).
  You can choose to see the modelled effects in percentage change (default choice, express the change in percentage) or absolute change (real value).
