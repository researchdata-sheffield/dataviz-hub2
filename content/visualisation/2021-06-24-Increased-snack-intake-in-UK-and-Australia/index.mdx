description: A new study led by the University of Sheffield suggests that treats, such as sweets, chocolate and salty treats, increased for some people during Covid-19 lockdowns. People with low control over their cravings were most at risk of increasing their snack intake during the lockdown. Researchers warn about weight and health related issues for at-risk adults due to the impact of lockdowns on our eating behaviours.
