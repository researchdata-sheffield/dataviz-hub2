title: "Overfishing and habitat loss drive range contraction of iconic marine fishes to near extinction"
thumbnail: ./thumb.jpg
description: Researchers develop a space-for-time approach to track the spatial contraction and drivers of decline of sawfishes. These iconic and endangered shark-like rays were once found in warm, coastal waters of 90 nations and are now presumed extinct in more than half (n = 46). Researchers also predict that sawfishes are gone from at least nine additional nations.
