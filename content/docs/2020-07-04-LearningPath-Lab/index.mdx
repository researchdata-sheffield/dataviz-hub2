        This is the <b>second learning path</b> prepared from the Dataviz.Shef
        team that is specifically designed for those who have completed{" "}

        </b>{" "}
        or those with some experience in data visualisations and programming
        languages such as Python, R, or Matlab. If not, it is recommended that
        you go through the first learning path first before you read on.{" "}
        <br /> <br />
        You will soon find out that we are often referring to external resources
        this is because there are already enormous amazing resources available
        on the internet, we have organised them in relevant sections for you to
        check out. In addition, the university has a partnership with <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/nap/service/redirect/lilearning">
          <b>Linkedin Learning</b>
        </a> providing thousands of online training courses to staff and students
        through <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/muse">
          <b>MUSE</b>
        </a>, we have also included some useful courses to help you get started.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Unlike the previous learning path where most of the resources concentrated
        on concepts of data visualisations and guides for coding, this learning
        path will mainly focus on exploring what we can do with each programming
        language to produce suitable data visualisations. In each of the languages
        there are three sections for you to explore, <b>Data processing</b>, <b>
          Data visualisation
        </b>, and <b>Share</b>. Choose a programming language to get started.

            Most of the time, knowing one or two packages/framework is
            sufficient for building an interactive visualisation. For example, a
            common match is <b>Shiny</b> and <b>ggplot2</b> working together to
            produce a web-based application.

            It would be a good idea to share your data visualisation to the
            world via some web hosting services or some website. Amazingly,
            Shiny and Dash (by Plotly) both provide solutions that allow people
            around the world to interact with your data visualisations. For
            other javascript based packages, you can embed most of them into
            your website directly or via iframe.

            Like Dash for Python and Shiny for R, Matlab also has an App
            Designer which can be hosted on the web, letting users explore your
            data using visualisations. You can find an introduction to the
            Matlab App Designer{" "}
