        </p>
        <p>
          Data visualisation generally considered as the graphical
          representation of information and data, it is currently an extremely
          active and critical aspect in research, teaching, and development, and
          is closely related to information graphics, information visualisation,
          scientific visualisation, and statistical graphics.
          <img src="./img1.jpg" alt="dashboard with visualisations" />
          The main purpose of data visualisation is to communicate information
          clearly and effectively by means of graphical representation. However,
          this does not mean that data visualisation must be boring for its
          functional purpose, or extremely complicated to look gorgeous.
          <br /> <br /> In order to effectively communicate ideas and concepts, aesthetic
          and functions need to go hand in hand, and by visually communicating key
          aspects and features, we get deep insights into fairly sparse and complex
          datasets.

          The huge amount of data is one of the characteristics of the Internet
          era. Learn to quickly digest and absorb useful information in huge
          data groups can greatly help to seize opportunities. Studies have
          shown that the amount of information we use visually is far greater
          than other senses. This also means that the possibility of finding
          relevant information through data visualization is far greater than
          other methods, and it allow viewers to get more information.{" "}

          While many organisations and companies across different sectors relying
          on data to gain insights and optimising their products, data visualisation
          is not yet an integral part of research communication. Today, powerful,
          modern, open source, interactive and web-based visualisation tools have
          revolutionised the potential for research data impact, we are here to help
          our researchers make the most of their data and take advantage of such
          tools.
