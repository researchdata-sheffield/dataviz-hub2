    <span className="text-5xl">A</span> statistical model is a mathematical
    model used to describe the relationship between different variables. It
    contains a set of assumptions about the sample data and usually represents
    the data generation process in an idealised form. Statistical modelling is
    the process of exploring statistical models which could represent and best
    describe observed data. This process includes (but not limited to) initial
    selection of probability distributions, encapsulating assumptions as
    parameters, estimation of stochastic variables, sampling, and comparison
    between different models. Once a statistical model is drafted, the model
    will be used to test hypotheses, create predicted values (make predictions),
    and compute confidence intervals (an interval we are confident that values
    will fall into).

  <p>
    Most modelling methods that do not model the random component de facto
    assume Gaussian distribution. The most common exceptions are often growth
    models which will often assume a lognormal. The random component in
    statistical models can be either from something that is non deterministic or
    it might be due to deterministic elements that are unknown or noises in the
    system caused by elements that are not captured. Statistics is therefore the
    art of handling elements in a model that create random noise, and
    statisticians are agnostic about the nature of the randomness with respect
    to whether it is deterministic or not.

      In this learning path we will be introducing you to probability
      distributions for common variable types, sampling and how to describe a
      sample from a certain distribution, basics of statistical model, common
      statistical testing techniques, and many more.
