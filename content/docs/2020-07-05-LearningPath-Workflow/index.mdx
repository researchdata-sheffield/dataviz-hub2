          This is the <b>third learning path</b> prepared from the Dataviz.Shef team that is specifically designed 
          for those who have completed the <b>Learning path - Lab</b> or those experienced in creating data 
          visualisations using tools such as Python, R, Matlab, or Javascript etc.. If not, it is 
          recommended that you go through 
          the <b><Link to="/blog/2020/07/04/LearningPath-Lab">Learning path - Lab</Link></b> before you 
          read on. <br /> <br /> 
          We will be referring to external resources as there are already resources available on the 
          internet and we have organised them in relevant sections. In addition, the university has a 
          partnership with <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/nap/service/redirect/lilearning"><b>Linkedin Learning</b></a> providing thousands of online training courses to staff and 
          students through <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/muse"><b>MUSE</b></a>, we have also 
          included some useful courses to help you get started. <br/><br/>
          The previous learning path focused on exploring what we can do with each programming language 
          to produce suitable data visualisations through three stages: <b>data processing</b>, &nbsp;
          <b>Data visualisation</b>, and <b>Share</b>. This learning path will guide you through a reproducible workflow 
          and how it might help you to increase your research impact.

      <p className="text-brand-blue font-bold text-4xl leading-10">Reproducibility</p>
      <p>
        In computer science, <b>reproducibility</b> means that as long as the environment and initial 
        conditions are the same, when the program is executed or the program is executed repeatedly, no 
        matter if it is executed from beginning to end without stopping, or "stop and restart" execution, 
        we will get the <b>same result</b>. Therefore, reproducibility of data visualisation should follow the 
        same principle. <br/><br/>
        Given the data and code provided (by an author) we should be able to get the 
        same output by following the same steps as the author does. But how do we ensure that data and 
        code are preserved and is accessible even after a long period of time for further research or 
        reference is important for data visulisations as well as for publications. We hope you will find 
        this information useful and if you have any questions or have found any errors in this page please 
        contact us on our communication 
        channels (<a href="mailto:rdm@sheffield.ac.uk">email</a>, <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/shef-dataviz/signup">slack</a>, <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/?hl=en#!forum/shef_dataviz-group">google group</a>).

      <p>
        Sometimes two researchers could have the same name or initials due to culture differences and 
        writing systems etc, it is important that there is a mechanism for identifying who you are 
        regardless where and when you published articles, datasets, and make other contributions. To 
        resolve this problem, <b>ORCID</b> (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) was introduced in 2012 that 
        can <i>provide a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) that distinguishes you from other 
        researchers and a record that supports automatic links among all your professional activities. 
        Your <b>ORCID iD</b> and connections are stored in the ORCID Registry, in an account you 
        own and manage</i>. To register, visit <a href="https://orcid.org/register">orcid.org</a>.

      <p>
        Identifying datasets and codes is equally important to identify 
        yourself. <b>DOI</b> (digital object identifier) was introduced in 2000 to identify many resources across 
        academic, professional, and government information, this will help you to include your datasets 
        and code within your publication through <b>DOI</b>. If other researchers can easily locate your data 
        and make use of it to reproduce your work to make sense of your data and communicate findings 
        more widely. Read the <a anchor href="#sec5">next section</a> to learn more about options of data repositories you can use.

      <p className="text-brand-blue font-bold text-4xl leading-8">Deposit your data</p>
      <p>
        For reproducibility purposes we advise you to deposit data and codes in data repositories that 
        can be <b>accessed and cited by anyone</b> around the world through a 
        unique <b>DOI</b> (digital object identifier). For some repositories it is possible to use programming 
        languages like Python and R to fetch data directly from the source using URL provided. If your 
        data is not classified as sensitive data and no discipline-specific repository is available, we 
        encourage you to deposit data and code in University's data 
        repository (powered by <a href="https://figshare.com/">figshare</a>) - <b><a href="https://orda.shef.ac.uk">Online Research Data</a> (ORDA)</b>. For other 
        recommendations including discipline-specific repositories, visit 
        The University Libraryâ€™s <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/rdm/repositories">Research Data Repositories Page</a>.

        There might be cases where your data comes from external sources like <b>data.gov.uk</b>, don't forget 
        acknowledge the source of the information in your data and state the <b>licence</b> applied to.

        We also encourage you not to limit to data visulisation and to visit The University 
        Library <b><a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/rdm">RDM page</a></b> to give you a broad 
        overview of Research Data Management at the university and many specific guidances.
