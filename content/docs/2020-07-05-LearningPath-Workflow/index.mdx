          This is the <b>third learning path</b> prepared from the Dataviz.Shef
          team that is specifically designed for those who have completed the{" "}
          <b>Learning path - Lab</b> or those experienced in creating data
          visualisations using tools such as Python, R, Matlab, or Javascript
          etc.. If not, it is recommended that you go through the{" "}
          <b>

          </b>{" "}
          before you read on. <br /> <br />
          We will be referring to external resources as there are already resources
          available on the internet and we have organised them in relevant sections.
          In addition, the university has a partnership with <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/nap/service/redirect/lilearning">
            <b>Linkedin Learning</b>
          </a> providing thousands of online training courses to staff and students
          through <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/muse">
            <b>MUSE</b>
          </a>, we have also included some useful courses to help you get started.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          The previous learning path focused on exploring what we can do with each
          programming language to produce suitable data visualisations through three
          stages: <b>data processing</b>, &nbsp;
          <b>Data visualisation</b>, and <b>Share</b>. This learning path will
          guide you through a reproducible workflow and how it might help you to
          increase your research impact.

      Reproducibility
    </p>
    <p>
      In computer science, <b>reproducibility</b> means that as long as the
      environment and initial conditions are the same, when the program is
      executed or the program is executed repeatedly, no matter if it is
      executed from beginning to end without stopping, or "stop and restart"
      execution, we will get the <b>same result</b>. Therefore, reproducibility
      of data visualisation should follow the same principle. <br />
      <br />
      Given the data and code provided (by an author) we should be able to get
      the same output by following the same steps as the author does. But how do
      we ensure that data and code are preserved and is accessible even after a
      long period of time for further research or reference is important for
      data visulisations as well as for publications. We hope you will find this
      information useful and if you have any questions or have found any errors
      in this page please contact us on our communication channels (
      <a href="mailto:rdm@sheffield.ac.uk">email</a>,{" "}

    <p>
      Sometimes two researchers could have the same name or initials due to
      culture differences and writing systems etc, it is important that there is
      a mechanism for identifying who you are regardless where and when you
      published articles, datasets, and make other contributions. To resolve
      this problem, <b>ORCID</b> (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) was
      introduced in 2012 that can{" "}
      <i>
        provide a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) that distinguishes
        you from other researchers and a record that supports automatic links
        among all your professional activities. Your <b>ORCID iD</b> and
        connections are stored in the ORCID Registry, in an account you own and
        manage
      </i>
      . To register, visit <a href="https://orcid.org/register">orcid.org</a>.

      Identifying datasets and codes is equally important to identify yourself.{" "}
      <b>DOI</b> (digital object identifier) was introduced in 2000 to identify
      many resources across academic, professional, and government information,
      this will help you to include your datasets and code within your
      publication through <b>DOI</b>. If other researchers can easily locate
      your data and make use of it to reproduce your work to make sense of your
      data and communicate findings more widely. Read the{" "}

      Deposit your data
    </p>
    <p>
      For reproducibility purposes we advise you to deposit data and codes in
      data repositories that can be <b>accessed and cited by anyone</b> around
      the world through a unique <b>DOI</b> (digital object identifier). For
      some repositories it is possible to use programming languages like Python
      and R to fetch data directly from the source using URL provided. If your
      data is not classified as sensitive data and no discipline-specific
      repository is available, we encourage you to deposit data and code in
      University's data repository (powered by{" "}
      <a href="https://figshare.com/">figshare</a>) -{" "}
      <b>
